 <p>I am a tenure-track faculty member at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbr&#252;cken, Germany. Before joining CISPA, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Sheffield, UK and at the University of Leicester, UK before that. Prior to that, I held postdoctoral positions at the University of Texas at Austin, and at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany. I received my PhD from Saarland University in Germany.</p>
